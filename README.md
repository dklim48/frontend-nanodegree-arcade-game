===============================
Current steps to play the game:
    - Launch Index.html
    - The player will start at the bottom center. Use the up, down, left, right keys to move him.
        - I decided that like Pac-Man leaving one side will make you enter from the opposite.
        - Future revisions will have the character selectable.
    - Avoid the bugs that will appear on random rows at random speeds.
        - Future revisions will have the number of total bugs controllable with difficulty settings
    - Once you get to the river, you've scored and will reset to the starting location.
        - Future revisions will have a set number of lives, as well as keep a score in the top right.
